# RST - Uniform Random Spanning Trees

RST is a Python package dedicated to extracting uniform random spanning trees from graphs. It leverages the powerful capabilities of the popular libraries Numpy and Scipy, with core methods implemented in Cython to offer significant performance enhancements over pure Python implementations.

Author: AndrÃ© Panisson

## Features

- Extracts uniform random spanning trees from a given graph.
- Utilizes the power and efficiency of Numpy and Scipy for mathematical and scientific computations.
- Core methods implemented in Cython for optimal performance.
- Supports graphs of various sizes and complexities.

## Installation

To install RST, first clone this repository and then install via pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the RST package:

```python
import rst
import numpy as np
from scipy import sparse

# Define the adjacency matrix of your graph
graph = np.array([[0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]])
# Transform the adjacency matrix in a sparse matrix
csgraph = sparse.csr_matrix(graph)

# Generate a uniform random spanning tree
tree = rst.random_spanning_tree(csgraph, seed=0)

# `tree` is now an edge index representation of the spanning tree
>>> tree
array([[3, 1, 0],
       [2, 0, 2]], dtype=uint64)
```
